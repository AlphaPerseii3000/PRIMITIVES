**PRIMITIVES** is a Quantum Rhythm-Sandbox where you play as a Chaos Engineer attempting to stabilize an entropic universe by synchronizing the fusion of particles to the musical pulse of matter.

## ✨ Game Vision

> "Prove to the player that chaos is just music waiting to be tuned."

In **PRIMITIVES**, you alternate between a fluid **Wave** state to hunt for elements and a solid **Particle** state to violently fuse them in rhythm ("Hunt, Brake, Snap"). Create autonomous living machines where efficiency is heard: a well-designed system enters harmonic resonance and composes the game's soundtrack in real-time.

## 🕹️ Core Gameplay Pillars

1.  **Bio-Rhythm (Biological Rhythm):** If it's not synchronized, it doesn't exist. The music is the physical engine of the simulation.
2.  **Complexity from Simplicity:** Simple atoms with strict "Socket" rules lead to deep emergent behavior.
3.  **Aesthetic Logic:** An optimized system is always beautiful. Performance and art are one.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **Engine:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) / WebGL for high-performance 3D rendering.
-   **Audio:** [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) / Web Audio API for procedural sound synthesis and sequencing.
-   **Framework:** Vite + React (via React Three Fiber).
-   **Simulation:** Custom physics and quantum-logic shaders.

## 🚀 Getting Started

*Project is currently in early development.*

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (Latest LTS)
- NPM or PNPM

### Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | Build for production (TypeScript + Vite) |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run test` | Run unit tests |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage report |
| `npm run lint` | Lint code with ESLint |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Lint and auto-fix issues |
| `npm run type-check` | Type-check without emitting |

### Development Workflow

1.  **Start the dev server:** `npm run dev`
2.  **Run tests in watch mode:** `npm run test:watch`
3.  **Before committing, run:** `npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test`

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] **V0.1 - The Pulse Prototype:** Basic "Hunt/Snap" mechanics with stable Master Clock.
- [ ] **V0.2 - Harmonic Lock:** Multi-particle fusion and basic sound synthesis.
- [ ] **V0.3 - The Substrate:** Environment implementation and procedural ambient generation.
